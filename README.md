Winforms, GTK2, MonoMac, Xamarin.Mac versions are working (on Mac, Xamarin Studio was used - Visual Studio for Mac not tested yet)

WPF implementation is working nicely, but is missing event handler wiring to work in the same way as the other implementations. Patches welcome.

Note that there are a few ways of working with this system, so play with the 'mode' in the example code to see what works best for you.
